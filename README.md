# MyExploit-ShellShock
In this small repository you will find my first exploit, which takes advantage of the well-known ShellShock vulnerability on a vulnerable site. Here you will find the necessary tools to use my exploit and a proof of concept (PoC).

## ShellShock
ShellShock is a security vulnerability that affects Bash shell software used in Unix and Linux operating systems. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute malicious code on a system by manipulating environment variables.

In the context of a website, the ShellShock vulnerability could be exploited if the web server is configured to use CGI (Common Gateway Interface) scripts that use Bash to process web requests. If an attacker can send a malicious request to one of these CGI scripts and manipulate environment variables, they could execute malicious code on the server and take control of the website.

Therefore, if a website uses CGI scripts that use Bash, it is important to ensure that the corresponding patch has been applied to fix the ShellShock vulnerability and that security recommendations are being followed to prevent the vulnerability from being exploited. In addition, it is recommended to regularly review and update the configuration and software of the web server to ensure that the latest and most secure versions are being used.

## PoC
Let's start by cloning the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/andrewxx007/MyExploit-ShellShock.git
    
To initiate the vulnerable environment, simply execute:

    docker run --rm -it -p 8080:80 vulnerables/cve-2014-6271
    
Access your browser and navigate to localhost:8080. If everything is working correctly, a page similar to this one will be displayed.

## Usage
Grant the necessary permissions to the exploit script.

    chmod +x myexploit-shellshock.sh

This is a sample code snippet in exploit-deface.sh that can be executed on an image. 

    ./myexploit-shellshock.sh <ip> <port>

For instance, if you run it using the command provided above.

    ./myexploit-shellshock.sh localhost 8080

Refresh your browser and your website has just become a victim of my ShellShock exploit!

## What happened?
This is a shell script that exploits a vulnerability in a CGI (Common Gateway Interface) program running on a remote web server that is affected by the vulnerability known as "Shellshock".

The script checks whether the user has provided the necessary IP and port arguments for exploitation. If the user hasn't provided the required arguments, a message will be displayed indicating how to use the script correctly.

Then, the script uses the "curl" command to send the exploit to the remote web server via the CGI vulnerability. The exploit uses a malicious "user-agent" that exploits the "Shellshock" vulnerability to execute a malicious command on the server. In this case, the malicious command is to create an HTML file in the "/var/www/" directory with a defacement message.

Once the exploit is successfully sent to the server, the script uses the "curl" command to verify if the defacement page has been implemented correctly on the remote web server. Finally, the script displays a message indicating that the exploit has completed successfully.
