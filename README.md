# MyExploit-ShellShock
In this small repository you will find my first exploit, which takes advantage of the well-known ShellShock vulnerability on a vulnerable site. Here you will find the necessary tools to use my exploit and a proof of concept (PoC).

## ShellShock
ShellShock is a security vulnerability that affects Bash shell software used in Unix and Linux operating systems. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute malicious code on a system by manipulating environment variables.

In the context of a website, the ShellShock vulnerability could be exploited if the web server is configured to use CGI (Common Gateway Interface) scripts that use Bash to process web requests. If an attacker can send a malicious request to one of these CGI scripts and manipulate environment variables, they could execute malicious code on the server and take control of the website.

Therefore, if a website uses CGI scripts that use Bash, it is important to ensure that the corresponding patch has been applied to fix the ShellShock vulnerability and that security recommendations are being followed to prevent the vulnerability from being exploited. In addition, it is recommended to regularly review and update the configuration and software of the web server to ensure that the latest and most secure versions are being used.

## PoC
Let's start by cloning the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/andrewxx007/MyExploit-ShellShock.git
    
To initiate the vulnerable environment, simply execute:

    docker run --rm -it -p 8080:80 vulnerables/cve-2014-6271
    
Access your browser and navigate to localhost:8080. If everything is working correctly, a page similar to this one will be displayed.
